# Practicum AI git and GitHub.com

As we've seen, AI is powered by code--Python code, run in Jupyter Notebooks in our case.

As a best practice, code should reside in a version control system. These systems allow collaboration, enforce good coding practices and foster collaboration and sharing. The most widely used version control system today is [`git`](http://git-scm.com/). Git is free and open source.

In addition to using `git`, it is possible to use one of many online git hosting sites. For *Practicum AI* we use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). There are other options, but GitHub is one of the leading online hosting companies and offers [educational discounts for students and faculty](https://education.github.com/).

**This training will start with some slides which are part of the source repository at: <https://ufresearchcomputing.github.io/git-training/#/>**

After going over the [slides](https://ufresearchcomputing.github.io/git-training/#/), we'll come back to this.

## 1. Setup: [01_git_setup.md](01_git_setup.md)

The [01_git_setup.md](01_git_setup.md) page has some basic git and github configuration information.

> To learn about setting up your github account to use ssh keys, check out the [01_git setup page](01_git_setup.md).

## 2. Continue on the [02_exercise.ipynb notebook](02_exercise.ipynb)

Once you have setup your GitHub account and ssh keys, you can continue to the [exercise](02_exercise.ipynb).

## Additional Resources

There are many great git and github.com tutorials out there. Here are some that I particularly like and have relied on in developing this training.
